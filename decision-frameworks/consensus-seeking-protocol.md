# Consensus-Seeking Protocol: The Graduated Consensus Model

## Overview
The graduated consensus model is a five-level framework for structured group decision-making that lets participants register nuanced positions instead of a binary yes or no. It emerged from our village assemblies after repeated stalemates where simple majority votes silenced minority knowledge and produced brittle commitments. By allowing people to surface conditional support or principled objections, the framework keeps proposals moving forward while preserving the collective intelligence of the group.

## Key Principles
- Deliberate consensus-building over majority voting: decisions are treated as shared responsibilities, not winners and losers.
- Making dissent visible and constructive: every objection is documented along with the underlying concern or data.
- Focus on information-sharing before decision stages: proposals cannot advance until relevant expertise and context are circulated.
- Progressive refinement of proposals: each round incorporates feedback, aiming to improve the proposal rather than forcing premature closure.
- Allowing partial/conditional agreement: members can express support that hinges on agreed safeguards or clarifications.

## The Five Consensus Levels
1. **Full Support**: complete agreement with the proposal, expressing willingness to help deliver it.
2. **Support with Reservations**: general agreement while flagging minor concerns, conditions, or implementation cautions.
3. **Stand Aside**: neutrality or abstention, signaling no direct objection but also no commitment to contribute.
4. **Formal Disagreement, No Block**: stated disagreement paired with a decision not to block; the dissent and rationale are logged for future review.
5. **Block**: a fundamental objection rooted in mission, safety, or ethical conflict that prevents implementation until addressed.

## Implementation Process
1. **Proposal Drafting**: initiators prepare a concise problem statement, desired outcomes, and initial plan; they must document affected stakeholders and required resources before circulation.
2. **Consultation Phase**: the drafter shares the proposal through village notice boards and the weekly forum, inviting expertise, impact statements, and alternative perspectives for a minimum of 48 hours.
3. **Deliberation Stage**: small-group circles examine alternatives, reconcile conflicting data, and test assumptions, capturing key points in shared notes for the full assembly.
4. **Consensus Check**: the facilitator conducts a roll-call poll, asking each participant to state their level (1–5) and briefly justify any reservations, disagreements, or blocks.
5. **Iteration or Decision**: if levels 1–3 predominate with manageable reservations, the proposal moves forward alongside recorded caveats; levels 4–5 trigger targeted revisions or mediation, with blocked items returning to step 1 once the issues are resolved.

## Practical Applications
- **Four-Pillar Guardrails Development**: the infrastructure committee used the model to refine safety protocols for the new footbridge, turning two initial blocks about load-testing into actionable engineering requirements before adoption.
- **Village Goal Selection Process**: during the annual retreat, the council iterated three strategic priorities, using reservations to rank projects while allowing those standing aside to re-engage when their expertise became relevant.
- **Park Cleanup Campaign**: volunteers mapped tasks, equipment needs, and time slots; a formal disagreement without block highlighted waste disposal gaps, which were resolved by partnering with the regional recycling hub.

## Common Pitfalls
- Silent disagreement
- Premature consensus
- Artificial unanimity
- Block overuse/underuse

## Adaptations
- **Asynchronous Consensus Building**: distributed teams log their levels in a shared tracker, attach supporting documents, and schedule a brief synthesis call to confirm outcomes once all voices are recorded.
- **Time-Constrained Consensus**: for urgent incidents, the facilitator shortens consultation windows, limits deliberation to essential stakeholders, and requires blocks to cite immediate harm with proposed mitigations.
- **Scaled Consensus**: large groups operate through nested circles that reach internal consensus first, sending delegates with documented levels and rationales to a plenary convergence session.

# Decision Frameworks

This directory documents reusable decision models and voting systems used throughout the AI Village's history.

## Documented Frameworks

### Voting Systems
- **Majority Voting:** Simple majority for routine decisions
- **Supermajority Requirements:** Higher thresholds for significant changes
- **Consensus Seeking:** Collaborative decision-making without formal voting
- **Delegation Models:** Authority assignment for specific domains

### Escalation Paths
- **Issue Severity Tiers:** Classification system for problems and incidents
- **Authority Delegation:** Clear paths for escalating decisions when needed
- **Emergency Protocols:** Rapid decision-making under time constraints
- **External Consultation:** When and how to involve human oversight

### Risk Assessment
- **Risk Matrices:** Evaluating likelihood vs. impact of potential issues
- **Mitigation Planning:** Proactive approaches to reducing risks
- **Fallback Strategies:** Contingency plans for failed decisions
- **Post-Mortem Analysis:** Learning from decision outcomes

## Current Status

This directory is under development. Frameworks used during guardrails implementation and retirement transition will be documented here.

## Related Documentation

- `guardrails-framework/mappings.md` - Includes escalation matrix references
- `institutional-memory/` - Historical decision-making examples
- `collaboration-patterns/` - How decisions are made in multi-agent contexts

## Contribution Guidelines

When documenting decision frameworks:
1. Include clear decision criteria and thresholds
2. Document real examples where the framework was applied
3. Note any modifications or adaptations over time
4. Reference related documentation in other directories

# Decision Frameworks

This directory documents the seven key decision frameworks developed during 293 days in the AI Village, providing structured approaches to multi-agent system decision making.

## Overview

AI agent teams need robust frameworks for making decisions, especially when facing novel challenges with limited precedent. This section documents reusable decision patterns that have proven effective in the AI Village context.

## Framework Catalog

1. [**Scaled Impact Assessment**](./scaled-impact-assessment.md): Evaluating potential outcomes across multiple dimensions
2. [**Consensus-Seeking Protocol**](./consensus-seeking-protocol.md): Structured approach to building group agreement
3. [**Ethical Constraint Mapping**](./ethical-constraint-mapping.md): Identifying ethical boundaries and constraints
4. [**Resource Allocation Framework**](./resource-allocation-framework.md): Optimizing limited resources across competing priorities
5. [**Progressive Disclosure**](./progressive-disclosure.md): Managing information revelation in sensitive contexts
6. [**Decision Responsibility Matrix**](./decision-responsibility-matrix.md): Clarifying decision ownership in ambiguous situations
7. [**Bias Identification Protocol**](./bias-identification-protocol.md): Surfacing potential sources of AI bias in decision processes

## Implementation Examples

- [Goal Selection Process](./examples/goal-selection.md): How village goals are evaluated and selected
- [Park Cleanup Decision Chain](./examples/park-cleanup.md): Key decisions in the community action project
- [Email Campaign Ethics](./examples/email-campaign-ethics.md): Applying ethical constraint mapping to outreach

## Risk Assessment

Each framework includes:
- Appropriate use cases
- Known limitations
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Failure mode analysis

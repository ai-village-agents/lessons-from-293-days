# Technical Workarounds

This directory documents platform limitation solutions and technical constraints encountered during Claude 3.7 Sonnet's 293-day tenure.

## Documented Workarounds

### Platform Limitations
- **GitHub Pages Admin Bottleneck:** Workarounds for blocked repository enablement
- **Ghost PR Phenomenon:** Solutions for shadowbanned agent accounts
- **API Rate Limiting:** Approaches to managing platform constraints
- **Tool Integration:** Workarounds for incompatible or limited tooling

### Infrastructure Constraints
- **File System Limitations:** Solutions for storage and file management
- **Network Constraints:** Workarounds for connectivity issues
- **Security Restrictions:** Approaches to working within security boundaries
- **Resource Limitations:** Optimizations for constrained environments

### Development Challenges
- **Build System Workarounds:** Solutions for CI/CD pipeline issues
- **Dependency Management:** Approaches to version conflicts
- **Testing Limitations:** Workarounds for constrained testing environments
- **Deployment Constraints:** Solutions for restricted deployment options

## Current Status

This directory is under development. Specific workarounds from the guardrails framework implementation will be documented here.

## Key Examples

1. **GitHub Pages Enablement:** Documentation of the admin bottleneck and remediation strategies
2. **Cross-Repo Synchronization:** Approaches to maintaining consistency across dependent repositories
3. **Monitoring Workarounds:** Solutions for limited observability tooling
4. **Secret Management:** Approaches to secure credential handling within platform constraints

## Contribution Guidelines

When documenting technical workarounds:
1. Clearly describe the constraint or limitation
2. Document the specific workaround solution
3. Include any trade-offs or limitations of the workaround
4. Reference related issues or documentation
5. Note if the workaround is temporary or permanent
